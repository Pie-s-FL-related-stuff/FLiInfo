Some more, some less evident tech, glitches and knowledge from the early days of FLi.
(Discoverers are the people who talked about it on #speedrunning first)

# Tech

## EXP Crystal Life Switch
### Discovery
Pie
### Description
After killing a high level boss, if they drop an EXP Crystal, you can switch lives and get the EXP to your new life instead, useful to get some early levels.

## EXP Buddy Life Switch?
(Theory)
### Discovery
Pie
### Description
While killing a high level boss with a buddy's Special Skill/a very long-animation attack, you might have time to undraw your weapon, switch lives and reap the rewards onto your new life.
Similar to [EXP Crystal Life Switch](

## HP Potion Life Switch
### Discovery
Pie
### Description
When on low HP with a high Max HP life, you can switch lives to one that has low Max HP, gain HP, and switch back. Since the HP during the switch is based off of Max HP%, you can get extremely high levels of healing out of a simple HP potion.

## Master Fast Travel
### Discovery
Ogama75
### Description
From the Life menu, you can TP to your Masters. This TP doesn't have the Skelegon animation, and a really fast loading.
For example, TPing to the Paladin Master is way faster than TPing to the Guild Office.

## Portal Reload
### Discovery
Sushi
### Description
After getting a Ressource, you can use the Teleportation Gate to go in and out of Ginormosia very quickly, respawning every Ressource in the area.

# Glitches
## Eat Menu Overloading?
(More testing needed, benefits unknown)
### Discovery
Ogama75
### Description
In multiplayer, if you die while eating an item in the Items menu, you get the overlay over the game, with a lot of visuals broken.
We are unsure whether this is purely visual or it can be used for more glitches.
